Build a complete, modern, and professional website for King K Consulting, an AI consulting business.

Technical Requirements:

Use only standard HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no Node.js, PHP, Python, or any server-side code).

All code, image paths, and dependencies must be compatible with standard cPanel shared hosting on Namecheap.com.

The website should work by simply uploading the site files—no installation, database, or special setup required.

All assets and dependencies must be referenced with local relative paths or standard public CDNs (for fonts/images).

Design and Branding:

Use a minimalist, sleek, and professional look with a blue-based color palette (navy, light blue, white) and generous white space.

Typography: Use a modern, clear sans-serif font such as Inter or Lato, loaded via Google Fonts if necessary.

The company logo (provided as "KingKConsulting-logo", 300px width) should be sticky at the top of all pages.

Place a horizontal navigation menu directly beneath the logo, with smooth scroll links to Home, About, Services, Case Studies, Blog, and Contact.

The site should be fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

The target audience is small and midsize businesses (digital and brick-and-mortar) and solopreneurs who want to leverage AI for business growth, efficiency, and productivity—but may not have technical backgrounds or in-house expertise.
